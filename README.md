# **Inventory Web Application Project**

In this project, you will build a simple inventory management application for a single resource. That resource could be shoes, books, snacks, or anything else you are interested in.

Project Scoring
This project has two different parts on which you will be graded. Each part is weighted differently.

### Completion
** [Deployed App via Netlify:](https://creature-archive.netlify.app/)**

#### Set up: 

Create a GitHub repository.

Your GitHub repository should have a README.md.


#### Styling:

The page should have a cohesive and professional style, that makes use of a few specific colors.

The page should make use of CSS Grid, and include at least two columns.


#### On Load Features:

Users can see a header on the top of the page that includes a title for the web application.

Users can see three unique resources, that include the following fields and at least two others:
name
price
in stock

Users can see a "Remove" button associated with each resource.

Users can see a form that includes all fields for each resource, a "Submit" button, and a "Reset" button.

### Interactive Features

When a user clicks on the "Remove" button for each resource, that resource is removed from the page.
 and vice versa.

The form should require at least three of the fields of the resource to be required. If the "Submit" button is clicked and those requirements are not met, an error message should be shown to the user telling them exactly what is wrong. 

When the "Reset" button is clicked, the form should be cleared.
When the form is completed correctly, the form should be cleared and a new resource should appear at the top of all previous resources.
